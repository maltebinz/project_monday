# Project Monday Workflow

## Purpose
This folder structure is designed for a systematic content creation workflow that transforms ideas into polished final drafts.

## Folder Structure
- **ideas/**: Contains raw ideas of any file type provided by the user
- **examples/**: Contains high-quality reference examples that demonstrate the desired style and tone
- **final drafts/**: Contains polished output created based on ideas and examples

## Workflow Process
When tasked to create content:

1. **Read the idea**: Review the user's idea file from the ideas folder
2. **Analyze examples**: Study the examples folder to understand the desired style, tone, format, and quality standards
3. **Research**: Conduct any necessary research to enhance the content
4. **Create final draft**: Produce content that:
   - Addresses the topic from the user's idea
   - Matches the style and tone demonstrated in the examples
   - Meets the quality standards shown in the reference materials
   - Is saved to the final drafts folder

## Key Principle
Always maintain consistency by referencing this README and the examples folder before creating any final draft. The examples serve as the style guide and quality benchmark for all output.
